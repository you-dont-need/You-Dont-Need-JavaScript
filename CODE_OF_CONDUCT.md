# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body

nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject

## Our Responsibilities

response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Sending a Pull Request

Your Pull Requests are always welcome, but, before working on a large change, it is best to open an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers.

When in doubt, keep your Pull Requests small. To give a Pull Request the best chance of getting accepted, don't bundle more than one feature or bug fix per Pull Request. It's often best to create two smaller Pull Requests than one big one.

1. Fork the repository.

2. Clone the fork to your local machine :

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your username>You-Dont-Need-JavaScript/.git
cd You-Dont-Need-JavaScript
```

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

3. Create a new topic branch:

```shell
git checkout -b my-topic-branch
```

4. Make changes, commit and push to your fork:

```shell
git push
```
