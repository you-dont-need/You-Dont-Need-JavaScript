			Thankyou for showing interest, 
			here is a quick story of me and
			this website. My programming 
			journey started back in 2019, 
			few months before I started 
			studying CSE in LNCT Bhopal. 
			I am currently in my second 
			year and doing Technical 
			Content Writing Internship
			at GeeksForGeeks. I like 
			coding all kind of problems 
			from the very basic like adding 
			numbers to the complex ones like
			competitive programming problems.
			I love making projects and games.
			Infact this website is one of my 
			Web Development Projects which 
			is built using HTML and CSS.<br>
			<br>Languages known : C Language, 
			C++, JAVA, Python, JavaScript, 
			MySQL.<br> IT Constructs : Data 
			Structures and Algorithm, OOP, 
			HTML, CSS, LINUX, and Git & GitHub.
