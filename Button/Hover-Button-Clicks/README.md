# Button Hover and Click Effect Using HTML and CSS

In this project, we create a button with a hover effect and a click animation using only HTML and CSS. The button has a custom shadow effect that shifts slightly on hover and click, creating a dynamic interaction. When clicked, the button moves, and a transparent div with a border stays beneath the button as part of the visual effect.
