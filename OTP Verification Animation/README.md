# CSS-Only OTP Verification Animation

A beautiful, interactive OTP (One-Time Password) verification component built entirely with HTML and CSS - no JavaScript required!

## Features

âœ¨ **Pure CSS Implementation** - No JavaScript dependencies
ðŸŽ¯ **6-Digit OTP Input** - Individual input fields for each digit
ðŸ”„ **Loading Animation** - Smooth spinner during verification
âœ… **Success Feedback** - Animated checkmark on completion
ðŸ“± **Responsive Design** - Works on all device sizes
ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI** - Clean, professional design with smooth animations
ðŸŽ­ **Demo Mode** - Auto-fill demonstration feature

## How It Works

The component uses CSS-only techniques to create an interactive OTP verification experience:

1. **Input Fields**: Individual input fields for each OTP digit with focus animations
2. **State Management**: Uses hidden checkboxes and CSS `:checked` pseudo-class for state changes
3. **Loading State**: Triggered loading animation with spinner
4. **Success State**: Animated checkmark with smooth transitions
5. **Auto-Demo**: Demonstration mode that auto-fills and verifies

## Key CSS Techniques Used

- **Checkbox Hack**: For state management without JavaScript
- **CSS Animations**: Keyframe animations for smooth transitions
- **Transform & Transition**: For interactive hover and focus effects
- **Pseudo-classes**: `:checked`, `:valid`, `:focus` for different states
- **Flexbox**: For responsive layout and alignment
- **CSS Variables**: For consistent theming (can be extended)

## Browser Support

- âœ… Chrome (60+)
- âœ… Firefox (55+)
- âœ… Safari (12+)
- âœ… Edge (79+)

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser. The component includes:

1. **Manual Entry**: Type digits in each input field
2. **Verify Button**: Click to trigger verification animation
3. **Demo Button**: Try the auto-fill demonstration

## Customization

The design can be easily customized by modifying the CSS variables and color schemes in `styles.css`:

- **Colors**: Modify gradient backgrounds and accent colors
- **Timing**: Adjust animation durations and delays
- **Size**: Change input field dimensions and spacing
- **Typography**: Update fonts and text styles

## Implementation Notes

This component demonstrates advanced CSS-only techniques for creating interactive user interfaces without JavaScript. It's perfect for projects that need to minimize JavaScript dependencies while maintaining rich user interactions.

The verification process is simulated through CSS animations and state changes, making it ideal for prototypes, demos, or lightweight implementations where actual OTP verification would be handled by backend services.
